    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <p>This page is a quick guide to undersand and use Synk. Further information
    is provided in next pages.</p>
    <h2>Anatomy of a Synk Function</h2>
    <p>A Synk function is a standard generator function. The only difference is
    its content and the way you should call it.</p>
    <p>To define a Synk function, just create a generator function:</p>
    <pre>function* MySynkFunction (...args) {
    ...
}</pre>

    <p>One of the abilities of a Synk function is to yield a Snippet.</p>
    <p>A snippet is an object which can do some work and return the value
    to our current Synk function. The function will stay suspended until the
    snippet returns a value. A snippet can be synchronous or asynchronous,
    depending on its implementation and work.</p>
    <p>Any generator function will be suspended when an <code>yield</code>
    statament is found. In our case, we can yield a new Snippet:</p>
    <pre>function* MyDelayedSynk(){
    yield new Snippet.Delay(1000);
}</pre>

    <p>The above code runs the function, awaits 1000 milliseconds and return.</p>
    <p>A snippet can return some value by setting a property in the <code>this</code>
    pseudo-object. Most of snippets will set the property <code>this.return</code>
    to the expected value. It is the case of the snippet ReadKey.</p>
    <pre>function* OldReadKey(){
    yield new Snippet.ReadKey();
    alert('You pressed: '+this.result);
}</pre>
    <p>A snippet can even receive a parameter when needed. The snippet of DomEvents,
    for example, will expect you to tell what is the event to expect and what is
    the element or selector to use:</p>
    <pre>function* WaitClick(){
    yield new Snippet.DomEvent('click', '#myButton1');
    console.log('Event:',this.result);
}</pre>

    <p>Yielding a value other than a Snippet, will have no effect.</p>



    <h2>Calling the function</h2>
    <p>To call a Synk function, create a new Synk instance:</p>
    <pre>new Synk(MySynkFunction);</pre>
    <p>You can pass arguments to the function through an array in the second parameter:</p>
    <pre>new Synk(MySynkFunction, [arg1, arg2, arg3]);</pre>
    <p class="bg bg-info"><strong>Remember:</strong> the function will be a synchronous
    call while it does synchronous call, and it will be asynchronous when yielding
    an asynchronous call.</p>
    <p>It is important to mention that calling a Synk function in a standard way
    (<code>myFunction();</code>) without the Synk object will only create a
    standard passive generator. Nothing will happen at all.</p>



    <h2>A function inside a function</h2>
    <p>When you are inside a Synk function, there are two types of call another
    Synk function.</p>
    <p>Creating a new Synk object and making a default call can be different than
    expected, once the called function will not block the code if there is some
    asynchronous content.</p>
    <p>For that, we have a Snippet which allows to call another Synk function and
    wait for it to return before continuing our code:</p>
    <pre>function* myFunction1(n1, n2, n3){
}

function* myFunction2(){
    yield new Snippet.Call(myFunction1, [1,2,3]);
}</pre>

    <p>In the example above, we are also passing three parameters. It is optional,
    as Synk function does not need to exepect any parameter and a call does not need to
    pass supply parameters (non supplied parameters will stay as <code>undefined</code>).</p>

    <p>Whether waiting the function is not a behavior you want, you can just call it in the
    standard way:</p>
    <pre>function* myFunction2(){
    new Synk(myFunction1, [1,2,3]);
}</pre>

    <h2>Returning values from Synk functions</h2>
    <p>This behavior is planned, but not implemented yet.</p>
    <p>It should be done through a Promise-like way (but simpler). Once there is
    some implementation, this text will be updated and a new page will be created
    explaining how it will work.</p>

    <h2>What is next?</h2>
    <p>Here you should have learn that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a synk function is just a standard generator of ECMA 6;</li>
        <li>our secret is only the <code>yield</code> and the snippets;</li>
        <li>there is a specific way to call the synk function.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The next sections will explain about synchrony and asynchrony. This will be
    important to understand the behavior of Synk. Also, there is some performance
    gaps out of our control.</p>
    <p>In the right panel you can find information about what Snippets are available
    and their behaviors.</p>
